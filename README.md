doing the hello-world guide

Hello fellow new-to-github people, I'm Alek.
I've started to play around with Arduino recently.
My goal is to make a CNC drawing machine.
And a robot wersion of myself so that I don't have to get up early everyday to go to work.
My job's fine, but who wouldn't prefer to stay in bed?
